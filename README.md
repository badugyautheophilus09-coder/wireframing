# Wireframing  

## üìå Introduction  
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product, such as a website or mobile application. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality rather than colors, fonts, or final design elements.  

## üéØ Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process  
- **Clarity of Ideas**: Helps designers and stakeholders visualize the structure of the application before development begins.  
- **Improved Communication**: Acts as a common reference point for designers, developers, and clients.  
- **Early Feedback**: Makes it easier to identify issues and gather feedback early in the design phase.  
- **Time & Cost Saving**: Prevents expensive design or development changes later by clarifying requirements at the start.  
- **Foundation for Prototyping**: Serves as the base for more detailed mockups and interactive prototypes.

## üß© Key Elements of a Wireframe  

A good wireframe includes several essential elements that guide the structure and usability of the product.  

### 1. Layout Structure  
Defines how different sections of the page are arranged.  
*Example:* A booking system‚Äôs homepage might have a **header** for navigation, a **main section** for search functionality, and a **footer** with contact info.  

### 2. Navigation  
Shows how users move between different screens or sections of the application.  
*Example:* A sidebar or top menu that allows customers to go from the **Booking Page** to **Payment Page** or **Profile Page**.  

### 3. Content Placement  
Indicates where text, images, and other content will appear. This helps prioritize information for users.  
*Example:* Displaying the **search box for available rooms** at the center of the page ensures it‚Äôs the first thing users see.  

### 4. Functionality  
Represents interactive elements like buttons, forms, and input fields. It focuses on what users can do on each screen.  
*Example:* A **‚ÄúBook Now‚Äù button** on the room details page allows users to start the checkout process.
